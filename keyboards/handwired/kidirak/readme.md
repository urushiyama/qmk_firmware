Kidirak is a minimal 2x2 matrix keyboard to enter "å–œ (HappyðŸ˜Š)", "æ€’ (AnglyðŸ˜¡)", "å“€ (SadðŸ˜¢)", and "æ¥½ (FunðŸ˜†)" emojis.
2x2 matrix should be the best practice to understand keyboard structure, because it is the smallest structure in which can have "ghosting".

Kidirak is, uncommonly, powered by [Adafruit Itsy Bitsy 32u4](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducting-itsy-bitsy-32u4).
